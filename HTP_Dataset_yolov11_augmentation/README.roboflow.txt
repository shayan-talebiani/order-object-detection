The dataset includes 151 images.
House-Tree-Person are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -10 and +10 degrees
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
